                        valuable in building
                        an understanding of the connections and dependencies that exist between analyses. Based on their

                        interviewees were able to describe how they could profit from a preservation service being aware of

                    <li>Paper exercises #2 - Faceting exercise: This exercise was designed to generate an understanding of
                        the underlying
                        structure of analyses, as perceived by data analysts. It allowed us to better understand the value
                        of information
                        that a preservation service holds.

                        Questionnaires were created for ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. Besides the reference to the collaboration, 
                        they are identical. Thus, we only provide one.

                        Balsamiq archives: We prepared interactive Balsamiq prototypes for several LHC collaborations. 
                        Except for the collaboration name label (e.g. CMS), they are identical. Thus, we added only archives 
                        for one collaboration. We provided both the Simple Game Elements Design (SGED) and Rational-Informative 
                        Design (RID) mockups.
