                My work in <b>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</b> focuses on several key research threads: 1) usable privacy in smart home applications; 2) designing smart tangible interactive objects; 3) the design of motivating and rewarding
                applications across various application domains; 4) (scientific) knowledge and
                resource management and sharing with a particular emphasis on open science; and 5) integrating smart tangibles in mixed reality applications. Before I became an HCI researcher, I
                researched
                and evaluated software frameworks for controlling and testing custom-designed

                <h5>Gamification: motivating and rewarding applications</h5>

                <p>
                    Gamification refers to the use of game elements to motivate and reward
                    activities in non-game contexts. Points, badges, and leaderboards are some
                    of the most often used game elements. Typical applications that many people are
                    familiar with include sports apps ("Congratulations, this was your longest bike
                    ride ever!") and forums ("Your answers were rated helpful by 20 people"). Gamification
                    has also proven to motivate workers and make repetitive tasks more enjoyable. However,
                    merely adding game elements to drive business goals risks to alienate users. Gamification
                    design needs to be based on an in-depth knowledge of system users, the
                    application context, and the overall socio-technical framework in which gamified systems
                    are deployed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I studied how gamification can be used to motivate documentation and sharing
                    in science. This is important because research documentation and sharing are
                    usually perceived as unrewarding activities. At the time, we knew very little of
                    design requirements for gamification in the scientific workplace. We hypothesized
                    that scientists, who are trained in critical thinking, would be particularly
                    alienated by any system that made us of meaningless game design elements. Thus,
                    we first conducted a variety of user-centered research activities with scientists in
                    particle physics to map their expectations and socio-technical frameworks. We
                    documented target behaviors that our gamified research data management system
                    should support, and designed two gamified service prototypes that made use of
                    different game design elements and design strategies. We reported our various
                    design activities and findings in the following paper:

                <h5>Knowledge and resource management and sharing</h5>

                <p>
                    During my doctoral research, I studied knowledge and resource management for three years at CERN, a
                    key research laboratory
                    in particle physics. The goal of my studies was to understand how researchers can be supported and
                    motivated to document, preserve,
                    and share their data analyses in a structured way that makes their research accessible and reusable.
                    This is a highly important topic that
                    is closely related to the notion of openness and reproducibility in science. Facilitating science
                    reproducibility through the design
                    of suitable cyberinfrastructure is important, as scientists are often not able to validate and reuse
                    published work. In fact, it is a
                    common understanding that science, across all research fields, faces a reproducibility crisis. A
                    core issue lies in the effort required to
                    conduct reproducible research. Documenting and sharing reusable resources is often perceived as
                    unrewarding, because the traditional academic
                    reputation economy focuses on novel contributions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    CERN in particular, and particle physics in general, are great places to start understanding how
                    interactive tools can support
                    and motivate open and reproducible research. They represent one of the most data-intensive branches
                    of science that deals with
                    unique data management challenges. In this environment, I studied how data analysts exchange and
                    reuse information, how and why they
                    contribute to shared data management platforms, and what role research data management tools play in
                    the analysis and sharing process.
                    We mapped practices and needs in this data-intensive environment that we believe will become
                    increasingly relevant to the industry and
                    across the sciences, as they continue to face a growing amount of data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In our research, we found that knowledge and resource management tools that are closely tailored to
                    a specific environment, field of science, institute, or
                    experiment not only lower the effort required to make analyses reusable. They can even provide
                    unique and meaningful rewards and incentives.
                    We referred to <i>secondary usage forms</i> of tailored data management tools. Those are uses that,
                    while not central to the core mission
                    of the tools, provide meaningful benefits to contributors. At CERN, we mapped secondary usage forms
                    related to uncertainty coping, simulation
                    of useful collaboration, and the use of structured and automated workflows. The following paper
                    provides a good starting point to read about
                    our work on communication practices in particle physics and the design of secondary usage forms:

                <h5>Hardware chip controlling and testing</h5>

                <p>
                    I have been invested in electronics, PCB design, and microcontroller programming for a long time.
                    My first position after
                    receiving my Master's degree was as a two-year fellow in an electronics group at CERN. My team
                    developed an integrated circuit (ASIC)
                    designed to manage the data exchange with the CERN detectors that are installed in underground
                    facilities and exposed to high levels of
                    radiation. The chip, called GBTx, is a complex device which is configured through more than 300
                    8-bit registers. One of my priorities was
                    to design a user interface that allows chip users and testers to control the GBTx efficiently and
                    effectively, despite its complexity. I designed
                    and evaluated user interfaces with particular regards to their usability and ability to visualize
                    and communicate the internal state of the chip.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Testing of a radiation-hard chip like the GBTx requires specialized radiation facilities. Those are
                    rare and expensive. We travelled a few times
                    to a facility in Belgium, where we had a couple of hours of radiation beam time to test the chip.
                    Given those constraints, the control
                    and testing software needed to be able to analyze and communicate test runs and results immediately,
                    in order to allow for on-the-spot changes
                    to the test flow. Overall, I developed a complete software framework for controlling and testing the
                    GBTx chip. The framework further included
                    a web service available to GBTx customers to configure the chip for their purposes. The web service
                    differed from the control and test software,
                    as it only made a subset of configuration registers available to the clients. Those were described
                    in great detail in order to support non-experts
                    with the chip configuration.

                <p>
                    In the following, I added references to the GBTx test setup and the software framework that I
                    developed.
