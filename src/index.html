                                Sebastian Feger is a Full Professor at Rosenheim Technical University of Applied Sciences. He received his PhD on research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and User Experience (UX) at LMU Munich where he also worked for three years and four months as a postdoctoral researcher.
                                Sebastian's research threads include physical computing and prototyping, enhancing low-fidelity tangible prototypes through Augmented Reality, 
                                data management in data science, and Internet of Things (IoT) security and safety communication.
                                His doctoral research focused on the intersection between Data Science and Open Science, supporting and motivating
                                reproducible science practices through the design of suitable interactive tools. As part of his studies, Sebastian specialized
                                in gamification and knowledge management and sharing. Sebastian conducted three years of his
                                doctoral research at CERN, the European Organization for
                                Nuclear Research. CERN is a leading laboratory in one of the
                                most data-intensive branches of science. Sebastian was further involved in the 
                                design of CERN tools for assessing and communicating the safety of IoT devices. Sebastian received
                                the German federal Wolfgang Gentner Scholarship for his
                                research. Before embarking on his PhD journey, Sebastian
                                supported SAP Research Switzerland in an EU project on
                                infrastructure for autonomous vehicles and worked as a CERN
                                fellow on the design and implementation of a software framework 
                                for controlling and testing radiation-resistant hardware chips.
